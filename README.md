# Mouse-Tracking Experiment Code for Prisoner's Dilemma Study

This repository contains the code for a mouse-tracking experiment developed for a Master’s thesis, 'The Overt Behavioural Patterns in the Prisoner’s Dilemma under Social Pressure' in MSc Neuroeconomics. The study investigates the effect of pressure on overt behavioural patterns during the Prisoner's Dilemma game, within the field of behavioural economics.

## Project Overview

The code builds upon **MouselabWEB**, a popular process-tracing tool designed to monitor how decision-makers acquire information in web-based experiments. MouselabWEB is open-source and widely used to study decision-making in various contexts such as finance, military, and consumer behaviour.

## Experiment Description

- **Research focus**: (1) Which signalling behaviours on cursor movement are under observation (overt behavioural patterns) in the PDG, and (2) How does increasing social pressure affect overt behavioural patterns?
